What is logback-access?

The logback-access module integrates with Servlet containers such as Jetty or Tomcat to provide rich and powerful HTTP-access log functionality. 

Previously, it was part of the logback distribution. However, since March 2024, it dwells in its own repository at https://github.com/qos-ch/logback-access

Version 2.0.0 of logback-access supports Tomcat versions 10 and 11, and Jetty versions 11 and 12.

For further documentaiton see https://logback.qos.ch/access.html.
